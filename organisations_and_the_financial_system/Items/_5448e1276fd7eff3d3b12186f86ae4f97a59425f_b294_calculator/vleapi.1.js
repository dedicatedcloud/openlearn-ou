     * data), or for a specific group (all users accessing that group access

     * false for global data, or the string 'g1234' for group id 1234.
     *
     * The value of each key-value pair is limited to 64,000 bytes (not
     * characters) but can contain any Unicode. Keys may be up to 20 characters
     * and must contain only [A-Za-z0-9_-.]. Activity IDs and item IDs have the
     * same restriction. (Item IDs are only restricted in this way when you
     * set an activity ID for an HTML activity.)
     *
     * Setting a value to empty string has the effect of deleting that value
     * from our database and saving space, so we recommend doing that when
     * appropriate.
     *
     * You must pass two functions as parameters. Here is an example which sets
     * the value of the data item 'frog' to 'Kermit':
     * VLE.set_server_data(true, {'frog' : 'Kermit'}, function() { ... },
     *   function(message) { ... });
     *
     * In this example the 'message' parameter on the second function is an
     * error message string. The first function, with no parameters, is called
     * if the update succeeds.
     *
     * When not running in the VLE, always calls the 'error' function with the
     * message set to null.
     *
     * Especially when storing data for all users, you may wish to consider
     * race conditions. For example, if you are storing a count value, you may
     * use a pattern where based on a user action, you retrieve the current
     * value (say, 4) and then set a new one (say, 5). If two users do this at
     * a similar time, you will end up setting it to 5 twice. To avoid this
     * possibility, you can use the optional previousvalues and retry
     * parameters. If you specify previousvalues, this should be the object
     * containing the old values of the data, as retrieved by get_server_data.
     * The system will only apply the update if the data is the same as this.
     * If it is different, then the retry function will be called, passing the
     * actual current server data as its single parameter.
     *
     * Here is an example where we try to set a number to 5 but only if the
     * current value is 4. If the current number is not 4 then the last
     * function will be called with an object including the 'num' field with
     * the actual value.
     * VLE.set_server_data(true, {'num' : 5}, function() { ... },
     *   function(message) { ... }, {'num' : 4}, function(actualvalues) { ... });

     * Returns a new <div> containing controls that can be used to select a
     * group from a list.
     *
     * The onchange function will be called when the user selects a group, or

     * first the group object that is selected, and then true (meaning the user
     * selected it manually) or false (meaning it's the first one we picked
     * for them).
     *
     * Special behaviour:
     * 1. If there are no groups, an empty div (display:none) is returned and
     *    the onchange function is called with parameter null.
     * 2. If there is only one group, an empty div (display:none) is returned
     *    and the onchange function is called with that group.
     *
     * The returned div has class="groupselector", so you can style it in CSS.
     * Please be aware that the precise HTML contents of the returned div may
     * change between VLE releases if we find bugs or make improvements..
     *
     * You can specify groups in one of three ways:
     * 1. An array of groups e.g. returned by VLE.get_tutor_groups(), or from
     *    within a grouping in VLE.get_all_groups().
     * 2. The keywords (strings) 'tutor' or 'regional'.
     * 3. A string beginning with 'grouping:' and followed by a regular
     *    expression, such as 'grouping:^Tutor groups'; this will automatically
     *    include all groups from groupings where the name matches the expresison
     *
     * In all cases, this function returns immediately with a div containing the
     * control. In the latter two cases, the control will be hidden (display:none)
     * while an AJAX request takes place.
     *
     * The autoselect option, if enabled, means the system will automatically
     * pick the first group in the list (if there are more than one). When
     * false, 'Choose...' text will show and onchange will not be called until
     * the user selects something.
     *
     * The offline version of this function behaves as if the user does not
     * have any groups (calls onchange with parameter null).

     * If using the analytics system, you must call this function before any

     * on each page load. (The system counts a 'visit' only once per user
     * session, so repeated visit reports within the same session will be
     * safely ignored.)
     *
     * You can optionally pass an 'error' function with one parameter (error
     * message). If you don't supply this value, errors will be ignored.
     *
     * When not running in the VLE, always calls the 'error' function (if
     * provided) with the message set to null.
     *
     * @param error Function that is called if there is an error (Optional)
