We're surrounded here by gold in the vaults of the Bank of England. And historically in the gold standard, the amount of gold would have been related to the stock of money in the economy. Things are very different now. In the modern economy, where does money come from?</div><div class="clearer"/></div>                                                                                                      <div class="oucontent-dialogue-line"><div class="oucontent-dialogue-speaker">RYLAND THOMAS: </div><div class="oucontent-dialogue-remark">Well, let's start off with narrow or central bank money. As the name suggests, central bank money is determined by the Bank of England and consists of notes and reserves. And in normal times at least, notes and reserves are determined by the amount of notes that people want to hold or need for their transactions and the amount of notes and reserves that banks want to hold given the level of interest rates in the economy. It is not chosen or fixed by the central bank as is sometimes described in some economics textbooks.</div><div class="clearer"/></div>                                                                                                      <div class="oucontent-dialogue-line"><div class="oucontent-dialogue-speaker">INTERVIEWER: </div><div class="oucontent-dialogue-remark">Your article focuses on broad money.

And one of the key points of the article is that banks create additional broad money whenever they make a loan.</div><div class="clearer"/></div>                                                   <div class="oucontent-dialogue-line"><div class="oucontent-dialogue-remark">Now while this is nothing new, it is sometimes overlooked as the main way in which money is created and it runs contrary to the view sometimes put forward that banks can only lend out deposits that they already have.

Well, monetary policy provides the ultimate limit. Now in normal times-- say, before the Great Recession-- monetary policies is set through interest rates, and that determines the loan rates that are faced by borrowers in the economy and the amount of interest that banks pay out to depositors. And this directly affects the amount of lending that goes on in the economy and the amount of broad money that's created as a result.</div><div class="clearer"/></div>                                                   </div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
